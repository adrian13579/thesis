Results are shown for the JPEG2000 database and for satellite images acquired on a quincunx sampling grid. The design of efficient quincunx filters is a difficult challenge which has already been addressed for specific cases. Our approach enables the design of less expensive filters adapted to the signal statistics to enhance the compression efficiency in a more general case. It is based on a two-step lifting scheme and joins the lifting theory with Wiener's optimization. The prediction step is designed in order to minimize the variance of the signal, and the update step is designed in order to minimize a reconstruction error.

Known in scientific circles as the ‘Fourier Series’, this work paved the way for modern mathematical physics.

It has specific applications for those involved in the development of software and hardware solutions for multimedia, internet, and medical imaging applications, and for those pursuing research in image and video compression. The book is suitable as a primary text for a course in image compression; it would also be helpful in the context of a more general class covering multimedia compression at an in-depth level. Final year engineering undergraduate students pursuing projects in multimedia compression and/or communication would also find the book a useful tool. JPEG2000: Image Compression Fundamentals, Standards and Practice is written in four parts, to serve the interests of a wide readership. Representing about half the total text, Part I of the book provides a thorough and up-to-date background in the fundamentals of image compression, including topics not previously brought together in a single volume. Part 2 contains a complete description of the JPEG2000 standard. This description is written in such a way as to be completely self-contained from an implementation perspective, while it contains numerous references to the fundamental developments in Part 1. Together, Parts 1 and 2 serve the complementary roles of explanation and exposition in relation to both the JPEG2000 standard and modern image compression techniques. Part 3 of the book is devoted to the implementation and exploitation of the JPEG2000 standard, containing guidelines, suggestions, and analyses for both software and hardware oriented applications. Part 4 describes other key image compression standards, namely JPEG and JPEG-LS. The purpose of this material is to allow the reader to compare the capabilities and complexity associated with these standards with those of JPEG2000. This final part of the book also serves to provide a practical demonstration of some of the fundamental techniques introduced in Part 1 which are not demonstrated by the JPEG2000 standard.},

Our method utilizes PSO to overcome the wavelets discontinuity which occurs when compressing images using thresholding. It transfers images into subband details and approximations using a modified Haar wavelet (MHW), and then applies a threshold. PSO is applied for selecting a particle assigned to the threshold values for the subbands. Nine positions assigned to particles values are used to represent population. Every particle updates its position depending on the global best position (gbest) (for all details subband) and local best position (pbest) (for a subband). The fitness value is developed to terminate PSO when the difference between two local best (pbest) successors is smaller than a prescribe value. The experiments are applied on five different medical image types, i.e.,MRI, CT, and X-ray. Results show that the proposed algorithm can be more preferably to compress medical images than other existing wavelets techniques frompeak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) and compression ratio (CR) points of views.},

During acquisition, transmission, and retrieval from storage devices, generally images are getting corrupted. So, for further analysis images must get denoised. The noises can be categorised into different types based on their nature and origin. Researchers are still looking for the effective denoising technique. Wavelet Transform (WT) is an effective transform method for denoising. Similarly Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is also an important tool for denoising. Combining WT with SVD results in further reduction of noise. This paper proposes use of WT along with SVD for medical image denoising. Performance of image denoising is evaluated on the basis of Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and Peak Signal-Noise Ratio (PSNR). In the proposed approach, experimental results of WT-SVD combination gives better SNR and PSNR values than WT and SVD, if used independently.},

However, the optimal mother wavelet selection remains a challenge to the application of WT in EMG signal processing. This paper presents a detail study for different mother wavelet function in discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and continuous wavelet transform (CWT). Additionally, the performance of different mother wavelet in DWT and CWT at different decomposition level and scale are also investigated. The mean absolute value (MAV) and wavelength (WL) features are extracted from each CWT and reconstructed DWT wavelet coefficient. A popular machine learning method, support vector machine (SVM) is employed to classify the different types of hand movements. The results showed that the most suitable mother wavelet in CWT are Mexican hat and Symlet 6 at scale 16 and 32, respectively. On the other hand, Symlet 4 and Daubechies 4 at the second decomposition level are found to be the optimal wavelet in DWT. From the analysis, we deduced that Symlet 4 at the second decomposition level in DWT is the most suitable mother wavelet for accurate classification of EMG signals of different hand movements.},

However, most modalities exhibit inadequate contrast, weak tissue boundaries, etc. Thus, in this paper, contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) is done to improve contrast of mammographic images in order to ease the further processing and get accurate results. In most of the cases, the acquired enhanced image lacks some important features of the original mammogram which gets removed as noise by the enhancement technique leading to contradictions in the interpretation of the mammographic image. To extract better features from the mammogram images, discrete wavelet transform-based image fusion technique is implemented which fuses the original and the enhanced mammographic image together, leading to restoration of features of both the mammographic images. The performance is evaluated using dedicated metrics such as enhancement measure (EME) and entropy (E).},

   abstract = {This article introduces the third generation of an interesting tool created for time-frequency-shape (TFS) joint analysis. Called Discrete Shapelet Transform (DST-III), it improves both its predecessors, i.e., DST-I and DST-II, in such a way that nearly symmetric major shapelet functions, and consequently almost linear-phase filterbanks, are obtained. Following a brief review on important concepts, the DST-III formulation is specified in detail and complemented with a numerical example. In addition, a prototype pattern matching strategy, where a comparison with ordinary wavelets takes place, and a spike sorting application are also presented and discussed. Notably, wavelet expansions use to provide very concise signal representations, thus simplifying subsequent nonlinear signal analysis in both time and frequency and, consequently, bringing advantages for non-stationary problem solving in science and engineering. This reassures the efficacy of this new tool.},

This introduction to wavelets assumes a basic background in linear algebra (reviewed in Chapter 1) and real analysis at the undergraduate level. Fourier and wavelet analyses are first presented in the finite-dimensional context, using only linear algebra. Then Fourier series are introduced in order to develop wavelets in the infinite-dimensional, but discrete context. Finally, the text discusses Fourier transform and wavelet theory on the real line. The computation of the wavelet transform via filter banks is emphasized, and applications to signal compression and numerical differential equations are given. This text is ideal for a topics course for mathematics majors, because it exhibits and emerging mathematical theory with many applications. It also allows engineering students without graduate mathematics prerequisites to gain a practical knowledge of wavelets.},

   abstract = {Rationale and Objectives: Computer-aided detection and diagnosis (CAD) systems have been developed in the past two decades to assist radiologists in the detection and diagnosis of lesions seen on breast imaging exams, thus providing a second opinion. Mammographic databases play an important role in the development of algorithms aiming at the detection and diagnosis of mammary lesions. However, available databases often do not take into consideration all the requirements needed for research and study purposes. This article aims to present and detail a new mammographic database. Materials and Methods: Images were acquired at a breast center located in a university hospital (Centro Hospitalar de S. João [CHSJ], Breast Centre, Porto) with the permission of the Portuguese National Committee of Data Protection and Hospital's Ethics Committee. MammoNovation Siemens full-field digital mammography, with a solid-state detector of amorphous selenium was used. Results: The new database-INbreast-has a total of 115 cases (410 images) from which 90 cases are from women with both breasts affected (four images per case) and 25 cases are from mastectomy patients (two images per case). Several types of lesions (masses, calcifications, asymmetries, and distortions) were included. Accurate contours made by specialists are also provided in XML format. Conclusion: The strengths of the actually presented database-INbreast-relies on the fact that it was built with full-field digital mammograms (in opposition to digitized mammograms), it presents a wide variability of cases, and is made publicly available together with precise annotations. We believe that this database can be a reference for future works centered or related to breast cancer imaging. © 2012 AUR.},

Biomedical Image Analysis demonstrates the benefits reaped from the application of digital image processing, computer vision, and pattern analysis techniques to biomedical images, such as adding objective strength and improving diagnostic confidence through quantitative analysis. The book focuses on post-acquisition challenges such as image enhancement, detection of edges and objects, analysis of shape, quantification of texture and sharpness, and pattern analysis, rather than on the imaging equipment and imaging techniques. Each chapter addresses several problems associated with imaging or image analysis, outlining the typical processes, then detailing more sophisticated methods directed to the specific problems of interest.

@article{floryan,
   abstract = {Many materials, processes, and structures in science and engineering have important features at multiple scales of time and/or space; examples include biological tissues, active matter, oceans, networks, and images. Explicitly extracting, describing, and defining such features are difficult tasks, at least in part because each system has a unique set of features. Here, we introduce an analysis method that, given a set of observations, discovers an energetic hierarchy of structures localized in scale and space. We call the resulting basis vectors a "data-driven wavelet decomposition ." We show that this decomposition reflects the inherent structure of the dataset it acts on, whether it has no structure, structure dominated by a single scale, or structure on a hierarchy of scales. In particular, when applied to turbulence-a high-dimensional, nonlinear, multiscale process-the method reveals self-similar structure over a wide range of spatial scales, providing direct, model-free evidence for a century-old phenomenological picture of turbulence. This approach is a starting point for the characterization of localized hierarchical structures in multiscale systems, which we may think of as the building blocks of these systems. wavelet | multiscale | data-driven decomposition | machine learning | turbulence},

Experienced pipeline engineers are able to recognize those patterns in magnetic flux leakage (MFL) scans of pipelines, and use them to characterize defect types (e.g., corrosion, cracks, dents, etc.) and estimate their lengths and depths. This task, however, can be highly cumbersome to a human operator, because of the large amount of data to be analyzed. This paper proposes a solution to automate the analysis of MFL signals. The proposed solution uses pattern-adapted wavelets to detect and estimate the length of metal-loss defects. Once the parts of MFL signals corresponding to metal-loss defects are isolated, artificial neural networks are used to predict their depth. The proposed technique is computationally efficient, achieves high levels of accuracy, and works for a wide range of defect shapes.},

With the capability to provide both time and frequency domains information, wavelet analysis is mainly for time-frequency analysis of signals, signal compression, signal denoising, singularity analysis and features extraction. The main challenge in using wavelet transform is to select the most optimum mother wavelet for the given tasks, as different mother wavelet applied on to the same signal may produces different results. This paper reviews on the mother wavelet selection methods with particular emphasis on the quantitative approaches. A brief description of the proposed new technique to determine the optimum mother wavelet specifically for machinery faults diagnosis is also presented in this paper.}

abstract = { A critical problem encountered in structural health monitoring of civil engineering structures, and other structures such as mechanical or aircraft structures, is how to convincingly analyze the nonstationary data that is coming online, how to reduce the high-dimensional features, and how to extract informative features associated with damage to infer structural conditions. Wavelet transform among other techniques has proven to be an effective technique for processing and analyzing nonstationary data due to its unique characteristics. However, the biggest challenge frequently encountered in assuring the effectiveness of wavelet transform in analyzing massive nonstationary data from civil engineering structures, and in structural health diagnosis, is how to select the right wavelet. The question of which wavelet function is appropriate for processing and analyzing the nonstationary data in civil engineering structures has not been clearly addressed, and no clear guidelines or rules have been reported in the literature to show how the right wavelet is chosen. Therefore, this study aims to address an important question in this regard by proposing a new framework for choosing a proper wavelet that can be customized for massive nonstationary data analysis, disturbances separation, and extraction of informative features associated with damage. The proposed method takes into account data type, data and wavelet characteristics, similarity, sharing information, and data recovery accuracy. The novelty of this study lies in integrating multi-criteria which are associated directly with features that correlated well with change in structures due to damage, including common criteria such as energy, entropy, linear correlation index, and variance. Also, it introduces and considers new proposed measures, such as wavelet-based nonlinear correlation such as cosh spectral distance and mutual information, wavelet-based energy fluctuation, measures-based recovery accuracy, such as sensitive feature extraction, noise reduction, and others to evaluate various base wavelets’ function capabilities for appropriate decomposition and reconstruction of structural dynamic responses. The proposed method is verified by experimental and simulated data. The results revealed that the proposed method has a satisfactory performance for base wavelet selection and the small order of Daubechies and Symlet provide the best results, especially order 3. The idea behind our proposed framework can be applied to other structural applications. }

In particular we investigate two of the most sophisticated schemes, namely the Anderson mixing and the Broyden update, both generalized to the consideration of arbitrarily many previous iterations. For the Broyden method we give a new derivation which is much simpler than that recently proposed by Vanderbilt and Louie. We show that if the additional parameters invented bythese authors in orderto increase flexibility are used to optimize the convergence of the iteration process they in fact cancel out. In addition we prove that in this (optimal) case the Anderson mixing and the Broyden update as applied to the inverse Jacobian are fully identical. Thus we come to the conclusion that neither of these schemes is superior. Moreover, we show that Broyden update of the inverse Jacobian is superiorto updating the Jacobian itself. Finally we propose an extension of the Anderson mixing which avoids the numerical difficulties all these methods are faced with. © 1996 Academic Press, Inc.},
